TidalCycles (or 'tidal' for short) is free/open source software, that allows you to make patterns with code, whether live coding music at algoraves or composing in the studio.

The following songs have drum parts created using TidalCycles.
- Red Spiders Cometh
- Supply Chain
- Placards

This directory contains all the code to recreate drum patterns for these tracks when interfaced with Ableton Live. The code does not come with drum samples. You can add your own - and diverge from what the original song to make it your own.

You could also take things a step further and modify the code to make your own beat. That is the point this repository anyway.


Documentation surrounding how to setup TidalCycles and all its dependencies to get it running is available [here](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Userbase)

TidalCycles is not the only live coding tool out there. There is a multitude of languages, frameworks, APIs as well as a strong community to support it. You can find out more about it [here](https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding)

If you live in New York City - https://livecode.nyc/ is an excellent place to be.
