Instructions Unclear is the second album from Reckoner.

Instructions Unclear is an album built with instruments, voice and code - under the sorrow, malaise and paranoia for the hyper-surveillance of the personal.

This repository contains code, Ableton plugins and selected samples that were used in the making of this album. For more information on what they are and how to use them, check this [wiki page](https://github.com/reckoner165/InstructionsUnclear/wiki).
